            <h2 id="where-we-ship">Where We Ship</h2>


            <p>S. World Packaging Supplies offers shipping to all mainland U.S. states. We don’t ship to Alaska or Hawaii at this time.</p>



            <h3 id="processing">Processing</h3>
            <p>We process orders during our normal business hours.</p>
            <p>You are responsible for all return shipping fees. Shipping fees are non-refundable. S. World Packaging Supplies strongly recommends that you use a trackable method to ship your return. </p>
            <p>We make every effort to fulfill orders as quickly as possible, but sometimes life throws us a curveball. (Ahem, Covid-19.) If we are experiencing longer than usual processing times, we will notify you either on our site or by email.</p>

            <h3 id="shipping-rates-and-timing">Shipping Rates & Timing</h3>

            <p>S. World Packaging Supplies has multiple shipping rates, depending on either the product or the shipping method chosen. The shipping charge will be calculated and displayed during checkout. An estimate of the time it takes to deliver your order will be provided on our website. Please remember that the time it takes to process your order is a separate estimate from the time it takes to ship and deliver your order.</p>
